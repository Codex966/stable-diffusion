## Usage


Unraid template available on superboki's Repository (search diffusion in community apps)
  
Docker-Compose example for Easy-Diffusion: 

```yaml
version: '3.1'
services:
  stable-diffusion-test:
    image: holaflenain/stable-diffusion:latest
    container_name: stable-diffusion
    environment:
      - WEBUI_VERSION=01
      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all
      - TZ=Europe/Paris
    ports:
      - '9000:9000/tcp'
    volumes:
      - '/my/own/datadir:/opt/stable-diffusion:rw'
      - '/my/own/datadir/outputs:/outputs:rw'
      - '/my/own/datadir/cache:/home/diffusion/.cache:rw'
    runtime: nvidia

```

## Directory Structure

Each interface has its own folder :  
- **stable-diffusion** folder tree:  
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-easy-diffusion  
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-sd-webui  
...  
â”œâ”€â”€ 51-facefusion   
â”œâ”€â”€ 70-kohya   
â””â”€â”€ models  

Models, VAEs, and other files are located in the shared models directory and symlinked for each user interface, excluding InvokeAI:    
- **Models** folder tree :  
â”œâ”€â”€ embeddings  
â”œâ”€â”€ hypernetwork  
â”œâ”€â”€ lora  
â”œâ”€â”€ stable-diffusion  
â”œâ”€â”€ upscale  
â””â”€â”€ vae  
  
By default, each user interface will save data in its own directory, which is automatically created during the initial installation of the UI. To modify the storage path, you can edit the 'parameters.txt' file for InvokeAI and ComfyUI, while for the others, it can be adjusted via the WebUI.  
- **Outputs** folder tree :  
â”œâ”€â”€ 01-Easy-Diffusion  
â”œâ”€â”€ 02-sd-webui  
...   
â”œâ”€â”€ 20-kubin   
â”œâ”€â”€ 50-lama-cleaner   
â””â”€â”€ 51-facefusion

## Troubleshoot :  
First thing to try when a UI refuse to launch, remove the cache and the numbered folder (ex :02-sd-webui ) then relaunch the container
